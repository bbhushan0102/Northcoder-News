Northcoder news is an online forum, in the style of Reddit where users can create and read articles. This repository contains the front-end to the app which has been built in React.

### Objectives

1. Pull together all the front-end skills, technologies and best practises I have learnt.
2. Make asynchronous API calls to your my server.
3. Use HTTP request types to interact with your backend, and HTTP response codes to update UI accordingly.

If you haven't used the application before, please allow a bit longer for the server to wake up.

I've built it using a back-end API that I made a couple weeks prior. The API is built with Express.js and uses MongoDB as a database.
